# CPE 487 Final Project - Grid Escape
**By: Atharva Shaligram and Sean Anderson**

A 2D platformer game designed in VHDL and displayed on a screen using an FPGA board and VGA connector

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a 2D platformer game using a Nexys A7 board and VGA display. The project replicated common game mechanics from platformer games such as movement, collision detection, and attacking.

### Gameplay Win

### Gameplay Lose

### Main Aspects of Grid Escape:

#### Map Creation:

- The start of the game generates and displays the map, player, and enemies (purple ghosts) on the screen.

- Brick wall boundaries are created with staircases, mushrooms, and a flag at the end.

#### Player Movement:

- Four buttons are the inputs for the player movement, which are BTNL to move left, BTNR to move right, BTNU to jump, and BTNC to attack.

- Gravity is always factored in for the player, so player can fall off platforms if there are open areas.

#### Collision Detection:

- Collision detection dictates player movement.
  
- When player collides with flag, game is reset

## Expected Behavior

- When the game loads in, a map and player is generated and displayed on the screen.

  - Brick wall boundaries are created, with staircases, mushrooms, and a flag at end.

  - Purple ghosts are hovering over platforms.

- Player moves around the map.

- When player presses center button, they can attack and unalive enemies.

- Game time is kept track of.

## Modifications
Note: "..." indicates that there is unmodified code that has been purposely excluded

### `Game_Main.vhd` (previously pong.vhd) Modified
The top level file of our project was based off of `pong.vhd` from Lab 6. We added more ports in to include all of the directional buttons on the FPGA board which include BTNL, BTNR, BTNC, BTNU, BTND. We added one new componenet which was `tilemap_vga.vhd` that includes most of the game logic. The port mapping of leddec16 was modified slightly to include two separate display ports where one would display the current game time and the other would display the previous game time. A process was added to allow for constant update of the leds. Tilemap_vga port mapping includes clock, pixel row, pixel column and all of the button as in ports and red, green, blue, counter for time, and new_last_score (previous game completion time) as out ports.

### `map_design.vhd`
This code was reference from [circuitben](https://www.circuitben.net/node/24) but modified slightly for the specific screen used. The original code from circuitben is called `map_rom.vhd`. Since each tile was 16x16, the entire map would be a 50 width by 37 height tile map unlike the 32 by 32 tile map in the original code. The circuit tile placement of the map was also altered to create the map of our design. To allow all this, the below code shows the modifications.
```

### `TileType.vhd`
This code was also reference from [circuitben](https://www.circuitben.net/node/24). The original code from circuitben is called `good_draw_map.vhd`. Modifications were made to change certain tiles to our specific design. Specifically, tile 2 was modified to create an end flag (shown below). Only tiles 0 (air), 1 (brick), 2 (flag), and 6 (mushroom) were used.

## Original Code from scratch
### `tilemap_vga.vhd`
#### Important Behavior - Game Time Counter
The game time counter works by scaling the clock down so that each count up by 1 is approximately 1 second. Upon reset, the clock time will reset to 0. If the player is reset based on reaching the end flag, the game completion time updates the last_score (previous game completion time). Additionally, upon reaching the end flag, the entire game will reset. Currently this feature still has issues as the game time does count up but does not modify the previous game completion time.
```
    -- Game Time Counter
    PROCESS(clk)
    begin
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN 
            IF btnd = '1' OR test_tile_val_h1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_h2 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v2 = "010" THEN
                IF test_tile_val_h1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_h2 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v2 = "010" THEN
                    IF last_score > std_logic_vector(count) THEN
                        last_score <= std_logic_vector(count);
                        new_last_score <= std_logic_vector(count);
                    END IF;
                END IF;
                clock_scaler <= 0;
                count <= "0000000000000000";
                counter <= std_logic_vector(count);
            ELSIF clock_scaler = 34999999 THEN
                clock_scaler <= 0;
                count <= count + "0000000000000001";
                counter <= std_logic_vector(count);
            ELSE
                clock_scaler <= clock_scaler + 1;
            END IF;
        END IF;
    END PROCESS;
```

#### Important Behavior - Player Rendering
The player rendering works by drawing the player based on an origin point at its top left corner. The player origin is based off its current pixel location in relation to pixel row and column of the screen, and it is displayed to be 12x12 pixels.
```
    -- Player sprite rendering (12×12)
    PROCESS(clk)
        VARIABLE px, py, pc, pr : INTEGER;
    BEGIN
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN
            pc := TO_INTEGER(UNSIGNED(pixel_col));
            pr := TO_INTEGER(UNSIGNED(pixel_row));
            px := TO_INTEGER(UNSIGNED(player_x));
            py := TO_INTEGER(UNSIGNED(player_y));

            IF pc < 800 AND pr < 600 THEN
                IF pc >= px AND pc < px + 12 AND pr >= py AND pr < py + 12 THEN
                    draw_player  <= '1';
                    player_red   <= '1';
                    player_green <= '0';
                    player_blue  <= '0';
                ELSE
                    draw_player  <= '0';
                    player_red   <= '0';
                    player_green <= '0';
                    player_blue  <= '0';
                END IF;
            ELSE
                draw_player  <= '0';
                player_red   <= '0';
                player_green <= '0';
                player_blue  <= '0';
            END IF;
        END IF;
    END PROCESS;
```

#### Important Behavior - Enemy Logic (Display, movement, and unaliving)
The enemy logic is formed utilizing an enemy_alive flag to have the enemy be displayed. If the enemy flag is 0, it is not displayed. When enemy flag is 1, enemy is displayed and moves back and forth depending on specific set boundaries. Enemy direction is reversed when it hits a boundary. Enemy position is tracked and then used to draw the enemy in the same way that the player is drawn (based on origin value and 12x12 pixels).
```
enemy_logic_1: process(clk)

    if rising_edge(clk) then
        if btnd = '1' OR test_tile_val_h1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_h2 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v2 = "010" then

                    end if;
                else

### `player_controller.vhd`
#### Important Behavior - Movement Tick Generator
Movement tick generator uses a counter to scale the clock and slow how often movement occurs. This allows for slower, smoother, and continus movement with the player figure. Movement will only occur when move_tick is 1 which is only when the counter reaches the end.
```
 -- Movement tick generator
    PROCESS(clk)
    BEGIN
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN
            IF move_counter = 199999 THEN
                move_counter <= 0;
                move_tick <= '1';
            ELSE
                move_counter <= move_counter + 1;
                move_tick <= '0';
            END IF;
        END IF;
    END PROCESS;
```

#### Important Behavior - Predictive tile positions and movement logic
The movement logic process below which consists of predicting tile positions utilizes the buttons on the FPGA board for movement. The logic also includes a counter to limit jump height and consistent gravity. Additionally, the set up of the conditional statements allows for both simultaneous horizontal and vertical movement. Each time a button is pressed, the next tile in the direction of movement is discovered using a tile lookup that takes inputs from an instance of map_rom that are port mapped into player_controller. If the next tile is air (air tile number is "000"), the player will move in the selected direction, otherwise, the player position will not be updated (simulating collision). If the player is one the ground, logic is set up to set a ground flag, which is important in allowing the player to jump again as the player can only jump if they have touched the ground again after a previous jump. If the player presses the down button, the player position is reset back to the beginning.
```

#### Important Behavior - Movement Execution
Movement execution is based on the result of the previous movement logic. If the next tile in the direction of player movement is determined to be air, the player will move in that direction. Otherwise, the player position will not change. Note that player position only moves when move tick is 1. Player position is reset back to the start when it reaches the end flag (end flag tile number is "010").
```
    -- Movement execution
    PROCESS(clk)
    BEGIN
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN
            IF reset_player_1 = '1' OR reset_player_2 = '1' OR test_tile_val_h1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_h2 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v1 = "010" OR test_tile_val_v2 = "010" THEN
                x_pos <= STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(to_unsigned(212, 10));
                y_pos <= STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(to_unsigned(416, 10));
            ELSIF move_tick = '1' THEN
                IF test_tile_val_h1 = "000" AND test_tile_val_h2 = "000" THEN
                    IF offset_h = '0' THEN
                        x_pos <= STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(next_x_h);
                    ELSE
                        x_pos <= STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(next_x_h - 11);
                    END IF;
                END IF;

                IF test_tile_val_v1 = "000" AND test_tile_val_v2 = "000" THEN
                    IF offset_v = '0' THEN
                        y_pos <= STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(next_y_v);
                    ELSE
                        y_pos <= STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(next_y_v - 11);
                    END IF;
                END IF;
            END IF;
        END IF;
    END PROCESS;
    
    -- Position outputs
    player_x <= x_pos;
    player_y <= y_pos;

### Timeline of Work Completed
- Monday 5/5:
  - Design of Grid Escape mapped out
  - Initialized all files
  - Edited existing mapping/tile files and began modifying them
- Wednesday 5/7:
  - Edited existing Lab 6 files and integrated clock and VGA components
  - Created our own design of a map
- Saturday 5/10:
  - Worked with top-level file (Game_Main.vhd)
  - Added logic to player such as movement, collision, attacking
- Sunday 5/11:
  - Attempted to integrate all the files together
  - Worked with port mapping and component instantiation
  - Attempted to debug errors with jumping and mapping
- Monday 5/12:
  - Fixed some debug issues
- Tuesday 5/13:
  - Tried adding timing element with some success

### Difficulties 
- Collision and Jumping Issues
  - Difficulty: There was an issue with the player going through blocks when jumping to the right. Also, jumping was a big challenge as the player would be upside down or would float.
  - Solution: A detection mechanism was added to prevent the player from going through tiles and for the jumping, a flag was created to ensure that the player would hit the ground.
- Timing Display Error
  - Difficulty: The timer was implemented to some degree. While it would replicate counting in real-time, counting about every second, the final result of the game completion time would not be displayed on the left side of the seven segment display.
  - Improvement: We would recommend trying to delay when the previous game time is updated so that the time is not overwritten and just set to 0.
